AccordionMega_USB_Keyb
======================

Arduino Mega based Accordion midi controller using photo-interruptors for bass (left-hand) section mapping using the USB port on the Arduino Mega as class-compliant USB Midi device through mocoLUFA https://github.com/kuwatay/mocolufa and using a commercially available USB Midi to Bluetooth converter to transmit Midi to IOS or OSX devices. Using a commercially available USB midi keyboard for treble (right-hand) section with a powerbank as power supply and a commercially available USB Midi to Bluetooth adaptor or self-powered commercially available BLE mini keyboard.

This Project is an evolution of my other project https://github.com/JasonBugeja/AccordionMega_USB_Keyb
The idea is to remove the need for routing USB Midi through the Arduino USB host shield by sending the right-hand side midi information directly through a USB to BLE interface to an IOS/OSX device.Eliminating the routing through USB host shield improves latency.  Keep in mind that Midi travels at 31250 bps, that means that if you route it there is an inevitable noticeable lag. 

Having the left and right hand side of the accordion independent creates redundancy in case of failure and eliminates the need for cables across the bellows. The commercially available keyboard on the right-hand side will still benefit through the use of the bellows pressure sensor and if velocity curve cannot be set to "flat" on the device itself, it can still be filtered out through a Midi routing/filtering app such as Midi-Flow on IOS. 

BLE
----
Using any IOS device (iPhone, iPod Touch 6thGen or iPad) multiple BLE transmitters can be used at the same time.  I am currently using two Yamaha UD-BT01 adaptors simultaneously and they work like a charm without any perceivable delay.
